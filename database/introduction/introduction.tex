Navigation in human-cluttered environments is a complex task due to the unpredictable behavior of humans.


One way to tackle this problem is create models for the human behaviors, which are used to predict their possible trajectories. However these methods capture a set of pre-defined behaviors and may fail in mode generic cases.

An alternative is learning embeddings for trajectories, which map possible trajectories in lower-dimensional spaces which are used to map possible different behaviors, or used to compute trajectory distances.

We are focusing on trajectories embeddings, and how they are used on the context of social navigation.
