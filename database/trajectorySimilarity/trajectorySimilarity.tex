\section{Trajectory Similarity}\label{sec: trajectory similarity}

This section focuses on trajectory similarity methods.

Such methods have been used in different scopes.

Early similarity metrics are based on numeric methods.
%
These methods focus on computing a distance between trajectories based on heuristics or spatio-temporal characteristics observed in the trajectories.
%
They commonly are agnostic to the type of trajectory and thus have found use in many applications \rev{give a sample with citations}.
%
Furthermore, they are commonly grouped as non-learning methods, since the provided distance metric between trajectories depends only on the input trajectories, while learning-based methods depend on an available database of trajectories used implicitly learn a distance metric.

For robot manipulation these methods are used for ....

For navigation in urban environments these methods are used for ....

For Social navigation these methods are used for ....
