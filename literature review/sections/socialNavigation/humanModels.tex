\rev{check fernando2018soft+ for more methods to add here}

\rev{check [20-26] in \cite{tsai2020generative} also}

\rev{check \cite{narayanan2023ewarenet} for works that joint multi-modal information like facial expression and voice for predicting the intention, emotions and etc... probably fall out-of-scope here. I think this could be an interesting line to show in the survey}

\method{1995 - Social force model for pedestrian dynamics}

\cite{helbing1995social} is probably the earliest work on modeling human interactions for social navigation.
