\method{2016 - Learning Social Etiquette: Human Trajectory Understanding In Crowded Scenes}

\cite{robicquet2016learning} provide a benchmark for social navigation with interactions between pedestrians, skaters, bikers, and small vehicles. 
%
The benchmark contain images (videos) of these interactions in a campus.

A feature called social sensitivity is proposed, which incorporates a distance which the target prefers for avoiding collision and another in which the targets starts to deviate from its trajectory to avoid collision.
%
These parameters are learned with an energy-like minimization.
%
When plotting these parameters, clusters emerge with different navigation styles.
